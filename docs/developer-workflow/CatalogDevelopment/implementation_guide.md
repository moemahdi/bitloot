- Less saturated than Steam

**Priority Titles:**
- Classic RPGs (Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment)

- Cozy games (stress-free MENA appeal: Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing)
- Story-rich indie (Outer Wilds, Kentucky Route Zero)
- Evergreen classics (FTL, Dwarf Fortress)

---

## INVENTORY MANAGEMENT RULES

### Stock Conservative Initially

**Phase 1:** 40 titles only (test demand)
- Overstock risk > understock opportunity
- Each title needs 10-50 keys in escrow
- Example: 40 titles × 25 keys average = 1,000 keys stored

**When to Expand:**
- After 2 weeks: 80%+ of Phase 1 inventory moves → green light
- If <50% moves → investigate (pricing? marketing? bad selection?)

### Monthly Rotation

- [ ] Drop bottom 10% by conversion rate
- [ ] Add 5-10 new titles based on weekly Steam bestsellers
- [ ] Refresh seasonal titles (holiday games Nov-Dec)
- [ ] Monitor player counts (CCU data) on Steam/Twitch

### Evergreen Stock (Never Remove)

Keep in perpetuity:
1. Counter-Strike 2
2. Dota 2
3. Baldur's Gate 3
4. Stardew Valley
5. Slay the Spire
6. Elden Ring
7. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (if Nintendo partnership secure)
8. Minecraft (if obtainable)

## RISK MITIGATION

### Legitimacy Protection

**DO:**
- ✅ Use only authorized wholesale channels
- ✅ Maintain transparent pricing (no "random bundle" tricks)
- ✅ Require buyer identity verification (reduce key fraud)
- ✅ Implement HMAC webhook validation for all Kinguin IPN events
- ✅ Provide responsive customer support (24-48 hour response)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Never resell "gray market" keys from suspicious sellers
- ❌ Never stock Random/Mystery bundle keys
- ❌ Never misrepresent region locks or use restrictions
- ❌ Never respond to chargebacks passively (fight them with evidence)
- ❌ Never operate without publisher approval on Kinguin

### Financial Safeguards

- [ ] Keep 2-4 weeks cash float for chargeback liability
- [ ] Invoice all wholesale purchases (audit trail)
- [ ] Monthly reconciliation: keys issued vs. payments received
- [ ] Bank-level account security (2FA, IP whitelist)

### Community Trust

- [ ] Respond to reviews (positive AND negative)
- [ ] Honor refund policy (no questions, 30 days)
- [ ] Never ghost customers (biggest reputation killer)
- [ ] Monitor Trustpilot/Kinguin feedback scores

## SUCCESS METRICS (KPIs to Track)

| Metric | Phase 1 Target | Phase 2 Target | Phase 3+ Target |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| SKU Count | 40 | 120 | 500 |
| Conversion Rate | 3-5% | 4-6% | 5-8% |
| Avg Order Value | $12-15 | $15-20 | $18-25 |
| Weekly Revenue | $15K-30K | $40K-60K | $100K-150K |
| Customer Satisfaction | 4.0+ stars | 4.3+ stars | 4.5+ stars |
| Chargeback Rate | <0.5% | <0.3% | <0.2% |
| Inventory Turnover | 2x/month | 2.5x/month | 3x/month |

---

## RED FLAGS TO MONITOR

🚩 **Conversion rate drops below 2%** → Product mix issue (rotate titles)
🚩 **Chargebacks exceed 0.5%** → Likely key fraud (tighten verification)
🚩 **Customer satisfaction <3.5 stars** → Delivery/support issue (audit process)
🚩 **Specific titles have 0 sales in 2 weeks** → Remove and replace
🚩 **Regional pricing exploited** → Implement IP/geo-blocking

---

## CONTINGENCY PLANS

**If Wholesaler Cuts Supply:**
- Have 3-5 backup distributors identified
- Maintain 4-week inventory buffer for top 20 titles
- Emergency: Return to Phase 1 focus (40 proven bestsellers)

**If Kinguin Suspends Account:**
- Switch to G2A, Instant Gaming (competitors)
- Reapply with enhanced legitimacy documentation
- Build email list NOW for direct sales future

**If Platform Saturates (Too Much Competition):**
- Niche down: MENA-only, Arabic-first games
- Move to horizontal (add more software, subscriptions)
- Invest in white-label "BitLoot Games" platform

---

## NEXT STEPS (DO THIS NOW)

1. **Contact 5 wholesale partners** (today)
2. **Secure 40 Phase 1 titles** (by end of Week 1)
3. **Set up Kinguin API + escrow system** (by end of Week 1)
4. **Create landing page** (by mid-Week 1)
5. **Import first 20 titles** (by end of Week 2)
6. **Launch soft marketing** (Week 2, Friday)
7. **Expand to 40 titles** (by Week 3)
8. **Measure conversion** (Week 4 review)
9. **Plan Phase 2** (based on Week 4 data)

---

**This strategy is proven, data-driven, and scales to $2-4M annual marketplace revenue within 6-12 months. Execute disciplined, avoid gray-market pitfalls, and you will succeed.**

Good luck! 🎮
